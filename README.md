# Airport Terminal 3 Baggage Screening Analysis

## Background & Goal:

The Company Operation team sought to investigate performance challenges with the Hold Baggage Screening X-ray Machines at Airport Terminal 3. This analysis aims to identify underlying issues using bag throughput data for each machine in July. The goal was to generate a comprehensive report or presentation for customer delivery using Python Jupyter Notebook.

## Contributions:

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted detailed analysis to identify performance issues and trends.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provided actionable recommendations based on analysis findings.
- **Communication Skills**: Presented complex technical findings understandably for non-technical stakeholders.

## Action Plan:

1. **Data Exploration**: Filtered duplicates and explored bag throughput data.
2. **Visual Depiction of Bag Throughput**: Developed visual depictions illustrating bag throughput by day and time intervals.
3. **Heatmap for Demand Level**: Created heatmaps to visualize demand levels.
4. **Peak Day Analysis**: Identified the busiest day and time period.
5. **Distribution Analysis**: Evaluated equitable distribution of bags across machines and clusters.
6. **Machine Performance Analysis**: Analyzed average duration expended by operators at each machine.
7. **Level 2 Screening Analysis**: Determined the quantity of bags reaching level 2.
8. **Recirculation Analysis**: Investigated bags undergoing multiple screenings.
9. **"Time Out" Situations Analysis**: Assessed bags encountering "time out" situations.
10. **Stress Level Analysis**: Examined stress levels by machine.
11. **Error Rate Analysis**: Analyzed error rates and distinct bag performance.

## Insights:

- **Bag Throughput**: Identified cyclical patterns in throughput across days and hours.
- **Peak Day Analysis**: July 3rd was the busiest day, with mid-morning to early afternoon being the busiest period.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Balanced distribution of bags across clusters.
- **Machine Performance**: Analyzed average duration of bag examination and identified efficient screening at Level 2.
- **Recirculation Analysis**: Around 23% of bags underwent multiple screenings.
- **"Time Out" Situations**: Approximately 4.85% of bags encountered "time out" situations.
- **Stress Level**: Examined stress levels by machine.
- **Error Rate**: Analyzed error distribution and distinct bag performance.

## Summary:

The analysis provided insights into bag throughput, machine performance, and screening efficiency at Terminal 3. Recommendations include optimizing screening processes and addressing "time out" situations to improve performance during peak periods.
